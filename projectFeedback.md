* Phil Cutler *

Provided good feedback and constructive criticism.  Raised concerns about Parallel axis plot readability in the limit of a long, active acting career as well as a lack of information on new actors.  Liked the idea of the filmography visualization, but recommended using bar charts as opposed to circles anchored to a timeline.  He thought it was a neat idea, but did not see it's utility.  He admitted he does not like watching movies.

Overall very positive and excited reaction.  she loved the parallel axis plot idea and also agreed with Phil that a bar chart for the filmography timeline would be more effective.  She suggested scaling bars either by film rating or number of films in a given period (for a drill-down style barchart), as well as shading a given bar to convey additional information.  Ariel is a film buff and saw a great deal of utility in this visualization
